## JACDAC on Node.js with TypeScript

This example reads accelerometer, prints 3-axis data in the console and display a smile face on the LED screen when you shake it.

Download the project and run ```npm install``` (requires Node.js). Run ```npm start``` to execute and monitor the code.

See [this](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/clients/makecode/servers/) for how to flash JACDAC firmware onto your micro:bit V2. Or you can directly flash with the .hex in this project (which enables accelerometer and LED screen services on micro:bit V2).
